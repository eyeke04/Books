# Book Repository Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the Book Repository! This repository serves as a centralized location for storing electronic versions of books. Each book is represented by a file,
and the name of the file corresponds to the title of the book.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized with a simple and intuitive structure. All books are stored directly in the root directory, and the filenames match the titles of the respective books.

```plaintext
/book-repository
    â”œâ”€â”€ Book1_Title.txt
    â”œâ”€â”€ Book2_AnotherTitle.pdf
    â”œâ”€â”€ Book3_ExcitingAdventure.epub
    â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## Usage

### Accessing Books

To access a specific book, simply navigate to the repository and locate the file with the corresponding title. The file extension indicates the format of the book (e.g., txt, pdf, epub).

### Adding Books

To add a new book to the repository, follow these steps:

1. Upload the book file directly to the root directory.
2. Ensure the filename reflects the title of the book.
3. Avoid special characters and spaces in filenames for better compatibility.

```plaintext
/book-repository
    â”œâ”€â”€ Book1_Title.txt
    â”œâ”€â”€ Book2_AnotherTitle.pdf
    â”œâ”€â”€ Book3_ExcitingAdventure.epub
    â”œâ”€â”€ Book4_NewRelease.mobi
    â””â”€â”€ ...
```
